**Requirements, Features and Priorities**

Character Animations - user needs to be able to move around the game and it takes very little time to create blend trees and have characters animated/moving around

Main Story / Trigger Events to progress throughout the game - user needs to be able to progress throughout the story and be blocked off from certain areas if they haven’t accomplished a certain event yet.

Inventory for items gathered - items can be used to help with trigger events so the story may progress and to enhance a characters level.

A map of the world - user needs to keep track of where they are in the world and where other objects / towns are relative to the player.

Battle scenes - user needs to be able to battle other characters throughout the game

Being able to save at any point in the game - user needs to be able to save so they can come back to where they left off at.

Side Quests - gives users more to play and possibly expand on the map.

Connecting Firebase to Unity to have a username and password - users are able to save or delete data that way they don’t have to start at the beginning every time they play.

Game was made in Unity and written in C#. 

This game is a project for school. We do not have any rights or own pokemon in any way.
